  <p class="para-1"><em>Catalonia is a traditional region of Spain that is fiercely proud of its unique culture. Barcelona is the most-visited destination. This colorful seaside city is full of attractions and things to do, with a captivating medieval quarter, surprising modernist architecture, and a vibrant urban culture, and if you are visiting  the city you should not miss to visit the second hand markets.</em> </p>
  <ul id="encants-link" class="barcelona-encants"><strong><li >Encants Market</li></strong>
        </ul>
  <p> <em>This is the largest second-hand market in Barcelona and one of the oldest in Europe, as it dates back to the 14th century. In 2013 it was given a new home at the foot of the Agbar Tower near <strong class="barrio-name">Poblenou </strong>and holds around 500 stalls. <br> At the Mercat del Encants you can find everything from rare antiques to junk-shop style gadgets, books and clothing. The market is open on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., with longer opening hours during the summer. <a target="_blank" href="https://encantsbarcelona.com/es/">read more info about encants maraket</a></em>.</p>

  <p><em>If you’re interested in second-hand books, comics, postcards and newspapers then be sure to check out the Mercat de Sant Antoni on a Sunday where you can find old and antique material.<br> The market is currently undergoing renovation and has been moved to a stretch of the street <strong class="barrio-name">Comte d’Urgell</strong>, which is closed off for the occasion every Sunday.</em>

  </strong></ul>
<p><em> Founded in 2007, the Flea Market is part of a new generation of second-hand markets who are firm believers in the old saying “one man’s garbage is another man’s gold.” <br> There are actually two markets organized by Flea Market: Fleadonia, which takes place every first Sunday of the month in <strong class="barrio-name">El Raval</strong>, and El Flea, which takes place once a month near <strong class="barrio-name">Drassanes</strong> metro stop. .</em> <a target="_blank" href="https://fleamarketbcn.com/">for more info about El flea</a></p>
